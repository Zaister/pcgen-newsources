Whether or not it is a surprise round, when the outrider uses this ability, allies within range are no longer flat-footed (assuming they were to begin with). This ability replaces greater banner.

###Block: SEASON KEEPER
Nature Bond			KEY:SEASON KEEPER ~ Nature Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A season keeper must select an animal companion for her nature bond.
Seasonal Spirits		KEY:SEASON KEEPER ~ Seasonal Spirits		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Starting at ist level, each day when she prepares spells, a season keeper can imbue her animal companion with the spirit of summer or the spirit of winter. Spirit of Summer: The season keeper's animal companion projects a is-foot-radius aura of cooling and vigor. Allies in the aura can exist comfortably in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Summer born Triaxian. At 3rd level, the aura increases the power of the season keeper's healing magic-whenever the season keeper targets an ally with a spell that has the healing descriptor, the target also gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. At 9th level, allies within the aura leave no trails in natural grassy or forest environments, thus can't be tracked in such terrain. At isth level, the duration of the fast healing effect increases to 2 rounds per spell level and affected allies can ignore difficult terrain caused by natural undergrowth such as nonmagical thorns, briars, overgrowth, and similar terrain. Spirit of Winter: The season keeper's animal companion projects a is-foot-radius aura of warmth and calm. This aura allows allies to exist comfortably in cold conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Winterborn Triaxian. At 3rd level, allies gain resistance io to cold as long as they remain within the aura. At 9th level, affected allies leave no trails in natural snow or ice, thus can't be tracked in such terrain. At isth level, affected allies gain resistance 20 to cold and can ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. This ability modifies nature bond and replaces trackless step, venom immunity, and timeless body.
Wild Shape			KEY:SEASON KEEPER ~ Wild Shape			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A season keeper gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level - 2. If she has imbued her animal companion with the spirit of winter, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of an ice elemental. If she has imbued her companion with the spirit of summer, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of a plant. A season keeper cannot use wild shape to assume the form of an elemental except an ice elemental, and can assume that shape only if her animal companion has the spirit of winter. Similarly, she can assume a plant form only if her animal companion has the spirit of summer. This ability modifies wild shape.
